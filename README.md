How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way I found to ensure that the code is succesful and follows all the requirements set by the hiring company is, first, to take your time. Rushing to finish a program leads to many false starts, unwanted errors, and frustration as a developer, which leads to even more issues. Secondly, and most importantly, build modularly! Trying to build the entire program in one go and then compiling leads to many unwanted and unseen issues.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Reading through the requirements, I take the time to think about what each one means. Once I think I have a clear understanding, I take a notebook and start jotting down how I think the requirement should/ and would work in the software. From there, I start typing out the code. Once I think I have it down, I compile to make sure there are no errors, then I start on the Junit test case for the method. 

How do I approach designing software?

As I stated above, design modularly and a line or two at a time. The best way to make your life harder than it has to be is to code an entire program without checking to make sure it's correct and meets the requirements. Writing a fuction/method at a time, creating the Junit test, running, seeing the results, and then working from there, gives you the ability to work a step at time and make sure what you are doing is working.
